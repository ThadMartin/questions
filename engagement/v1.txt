Repubican Congressman Tom Coburn identified $65 million spent on low-priority National Science Foundation projects. His report criticizes the organization's oversight of grant funding, saying it has led to mismanagement, fraud and abuse as well as a lack of information about the outcomes of research, and says the agency duplicates efforts with other agencies and is bad at prioritizing projects.
